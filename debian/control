Description: Helper for NeuroDebian popularity contest submissions
 This package is a complement to the generic popularity-contest
 package to enable anonymous submission of usage statistics to
 NeuroDebian in addition to the popcon submissions to the underlying
 distribution (e.g. Debian or Ubuntu) popcon server.
 .
 Your participation in popcon is important for following reasons:
  - Popular packages receive more attention from developers, bugs are
    fixed faster and updates are provided quicker.
  - Assure that we do not drop support for a previous release of Debian
    or Ubuntu while are active users.
  - User statistics could be used by upstream research software
    developers to acquire funding for continued development.
 .
 It has an effect only if you have decided to participate in the
 Popularity Contest of your distribution, i.e. Debian or Ubuntu.
 You can always enable or disable your participation in popcon by
 running 'dpkg-reconfigure popularity-contest' as root.
